            everthing in this structure is NOT considered part of any  content of your web pages

            Most tage elements in html are done in pairs
            These are called opening and closing pairs
            There are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred to as empty tags (a.k.a void)
            The opening tag indicates the start of your element and the closing taf indicates the end of your element
            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS a slash (/) proceeding the name

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered content
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to manage some display of the page, give additional documentation to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search engines, and many other assists.

        <h1>Basic Html Tags</h1>
        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!-- 
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling righ and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect how the brower displays your paragraph conten. You can place your content on seperate lines yoursel and it will not affect how the browser displays your paragraph content.
        -->
        <p>
            The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when the content is display by your browser. The browser does NOT display your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in html file.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line. Did the Go Live update the browsers display of my saved changes to the file?
        </p>
        <!--
            If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag for the whole tag you would be in trouble using the tag
            instead: you can use special character strings to represent components of the tag such as < (&lt;) and the > (&gt;) symbols
        -->
